    Sometimes you’ll write styles for a .class that you only ever want to @extend, and never want to use directly in your <a href="#">HTML</a>. This is especially true when writing a Sass library, where you may provide styles for users to @extend if they need and ignore if they don’t.
 
    If you use normal classes for this, you end up creating a lot of extra <a href="#" class="error">CSS</a> when the stylesheets are generated, and run thea risk of colliding with other classes that are being used in the HTML. That’s why Sass supports “placeholder selectors” (for example, %foo).
